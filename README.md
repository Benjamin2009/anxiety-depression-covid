## Anxiety and Depression in American Households during COVID-19

### Introduction

Besides killing more than 1.1 million Americans to date, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused a heavy toll on mental health. According to the US. Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), 
> More than four-in-ten U.S. adults had developed symptoms of depression and/or anxiety during the pandemic!

Here we will explore a data set provided by the US Census Bureau to visualize the effects of COVID-19 on different social groups in America. The information may be of interest to policy makers, health care providers, scientific researchers, and the public in general.

### Data Set

The Household Pulse Survey respondents report symptoms that are associated with generalized anxiety or major depressive disorder, e.g., how often they have felt down, depressed, hopeless or anxious, and how often they have been unable to stop worrying or shown little interest or pleasure in doing things over the last two weeks. 

**Key features:** 
> * **Indicator**: Anxiety and/or Depression
> * **Group**: the demographic factor the "Subgroup" column was grouped by, such as age, gender and race, etc.
> * **State**: state name
> * **Subgroup**: subgroups in a given group
> * **Time Period**: one period = two weeks; the data set contains 52 time periods
> * **Value**: estimated percentage of respondents showing the symptom(s) of anxiety/depression

Data collection: Apr. 23, 2020 - Dec. 29, 2022 (as the time of writing)

### Key Observations

- This project used data from the US Census Bureau to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected psychological distress in American households. The findings clearly show that the pandemic has worsened existing health inequalities, hitting already vulnerable groups the hardest. People with disabilities, Black and Hispanic backgrounds, and sexual and gender minorities experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to others. Additionally, younger adults, females, and those with lower education levels reported more severe symptoms. These insights highlight how different social factors intersect to influence mental health during challenging times.
  
- Looking at the data by state revealed significant regional differences in psychological distress. Some areas were more heavily impacted than others, suggesting that mental health support needs to be tailored to specific regions. By identifying these differences, policymakers and healthcare providers can better allocate resources and implement targeted interventions where they're needed most.
